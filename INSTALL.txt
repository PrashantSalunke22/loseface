COMPILATION
========================================

  To compile Lose Face you need CMake utility

     http://www.cmake.org/

  With CMake you can generates Makefiles/Projects for your
  platform/compiler.

  E.g. In GNU/Linux you can do:

     $ mkdir build-gcc
     $ cd build-gcc
     $ cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles"
     $ make

  And that is all. The 'build-gcc' directory is the destination
  for all .obj and .exe files.

  For other platforms like Windows, you can generate makefiles
  for MinGW, NMake or Visual Studio Projects. E.g.

     >mkdir build-mingw
     >cd build-mingw
     >cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"
     >mingw32-make

     >mkdir build-msys
     >cd build-msys
     >cmake .. -G "MSYS Makefiles"
     >make

     >mkdir build-vc9
     >cd build-vc9
     >cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 9 2008"
     >start loseface.sln

  It is a good practice to create a directory (like 'build-gcc') to
  leave all .obj and .exe files, so then is really easy to clean all
  generated files (just removing that directory).
